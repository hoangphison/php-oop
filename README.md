#Interviewee Notes
When it comes to micro-services, Lazada Group has a lot of experience according to
our sophisticated system regarding e-Commerce platform.

We have applied so many frameworks through our project such as Zend 1,2, Symfony 2/3, Lumen, Go-Framework and Django as well.

Lumen is one of the most tiny and robust due to its simplistic which is awesome for any high-traffic service.

At Lazada, there's one Symfony 2.8 project which is migrated to micro-service approach based on Lumen.
These are benefit we consider to choose Lumen:
- Test Driven Development on Lumen is easy to applied to reflect our Business Logic, especially for Ecommerce Platform
- Test Environment is completely lightweight and robust either Unit and Functional Test.
- Lumen is closed to Pure PHP without any heavy concept compare to Bundle in Symfony.
- Easy to integrate any pure-php library
- Design Pattern on Lumen is straightforward to apply. Because our system has to integrate with so many 3rd party platform.

# Basic Backend Developer Interview

Dear candidate, please follow this readme and solve all questions.

> Before you can start, you should prepare your development environment.

**This test requires:**
- access to the internet
- your favourite IDE

## Test tasks:

**NOTE:** You are free to use any framework you wish. Bonus points for an explanation of your choice.

1. Specify a default controller
  - for route `/`
  - with a proper json return `{"hello":"world!"}`

2. Use the api.nasa.gov
  - the API-KEY is `N7LkblDsc5aen05FJqBQ8wU4qSdmsftwJagVK7UD`
  - documentation: https://api.nasa.gov/neo/?api_key=N7LkblDsc5aen05FJqBQ8wU4qSdmsftwJagVK7UD
  
3. Write a command
  - to request the data from the last 3 days from nasa api
  - response contains count of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)
  - persist the values in your DB
  - Define the model as follows:
    - date
    - reference (neo_reference_id)
    - name
    - speed (kilometers_per_hour)
    - is hazardous (is_potentially_hazardous_asteroid)

4. Create a route `/neo/hazardous`
  - display all DB entries which contain potentially hazardous asteroids
  - format JSON

5. Create a route `/neo/fastest?hazardous=(true|false)`
  - analyze all data
  - calculate and return the model of the fastest asteroid
  - with a hazardous parameter, where `true` means `is hazardous`
  - default hazardous value is `false`
  - format JSON

6. Create a route `/neo/best-year?hazardous=(true|false)`
  - analyze all data
  - calculate and return a year with most asteroids
  - with a hazardous parameter, where `true` means `is hazardous`
  - default hazardous value is `false`
  - format JSON

7. Create a route `/neo/best-month?hazardous=(true|false)`
  - analyze all data
  - calculate and return a month with most asteroids (not a month in a year)
  - with a hazardous parameter, where `true` means `is hazardous`
  - default hazardous value is `false`
  - format JSON
